# Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer purchase behavior using transactional data. It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning, data visualization, and automation to deliver actionable insights for business decision-making.

## 📊 Project Overview

- Performed EDA on 2,200+ customer records using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to identify key trends in product spending, customer segments, and campaign effectiveness.
- Built a **Random Forest Classifier** using **Scikit-learn** to predict customer responses with 91% accuracy.
- Developed **Power BI dashboards** to visualize KPIs such as sales trends, top product categories, and customer demographics.
- Automated data processing pipelines with **Python** and **SQL**, reducing reporting time by 50% and enhancing consistency.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python, SQL  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Dashboarding**: Power BI  
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

## 🧠 Key Insights

- High-income and middle-aged customers showed greater spending across product categories.
- Customers with fewer recent interactions were less likely to respond to campaigns.
- Web and catalog purchases were more frequent among customers with higher education levels.
- The predictive model helped segment likely responders, optimizing future marketing strategies.
